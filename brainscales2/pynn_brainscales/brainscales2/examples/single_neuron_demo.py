# In the current state, we only expose the neuron type 'HXNeuron',

# configured by passing initial values to the respective Population.
# Each Population may consist of multiple neurons (in this case: one),
# all sharing the same parameters.
# Circuit parameters control the dynamic behavior of the neuron as well as
# static configuration. Most of them are either boolean or given in units of
# 'LSB' for chip-internal Digital-to-Analog converters - they have no direct
# biological translation.
# For this first example, you may alter the leak potential and observe
# the response of the analog neuron's resting potential.

# The chip contains a fast Analog-to-Digital converter. It can be used to
# record different observables of a single analog neuron - most importantly
# the membrane potential.

# The chip additionally includes slower, parallel ADCs which will allow for
# parallel access to analog signals in multiple neurons. Support for this
# ADC will be integrated in future versions of our pyNN-Api.
